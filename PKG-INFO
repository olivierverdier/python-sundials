Description: **python-sundials** is a Cython wrapper for the Sundials solver suite.
        The wrapper is based on code posten on the cython-dev mailing list by
        Mr. Jon Olav Vik.
        
        **Highlights**
        
         * CVODE - Solver for stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential equation
         * IDA - Solver for the solution of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems
         * KINSOL - solver for nonlinear algebraic systems based on Newton-Krylov solver technology
        
        The CVODE and IDA solvers support root finding and the solver throws an exception
        on finding a root.
        
        There is also an example of implementing the explicit equation in Cython for speed.
