 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Example problem:
 * 
 * The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
 * needed for its solution by CVODE. The problem is from
 * chemical kinetics, and consists of the following three rate
 * equations:         
 *    dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
 *    dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*(y2)^2
 *    dy3/dt = 3.e7*(y2)^2
 * on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial
 * conditions: y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0. The problem is stiff.
 * While integrating the system, we also use the rootfinding
 * feature to find the points at which y1 = 1e-4 or at which
 * y3 = 0.01. This program solves the problem with the BDF method,
 * Newton iteration with the CVDENSE dense linear solver, and a
 * user-supplied Jacobian routine.
 * It uses a scalar relative tolerance and a vector absolute
 * tolerance. Output is printed in decades from t = .4 to t = 4.e10.
 * Run statistics (optional outputs) are printed at the end.
